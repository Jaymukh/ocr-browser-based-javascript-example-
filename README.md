Brouwer Cased OCR Example with Tesseract.js
Overview
This repository showcases how to implement client-side Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract.js—no external API calls required. All OCR processing is performed securely in the browser, preserving user privacy and reducing costs.

Features
Browser-only OCR: All processing is local; images never leave the user’s machine.

Tesseract.js powered: Supports 100+ languages, fast setup, and open-source.

Simple Demo: Upload an image and instantly extract text with ease.

Brouwer Case Support: (If you use a specific font or styling for "Brouwer Case," explain its relevance here.)

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Jaymukh/ocr-browser-based-javascript-example-.git
3. Install dependencies (React project)
bash
npm install
4. Run the example
Open index.html directly in your browser or use npm start if using a web framework.

Usage
Upload an image file through the provided web interface.

Click “Scan” or equivalent button to initiate OCR.

View the recognized text output instantly in the browser.


Why Local OCR?
Privacy: Images never sent to third-party servers.

Speed: Instant results, no network latency.

Zero cost: No monthly API or subscription fees.
